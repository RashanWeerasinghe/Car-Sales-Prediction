## Project Description
Car Sales Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict car sales based on various features and attributes. This project utilizes Python and popular data science and machine learning libraries to build and evaluate predictive models.

### GitHub Repository
- GitHub Repository Link: [Car Sales Prediction GitHub](https://github.com/RashanWeerasinghe/Car-Sales-Prediction.git)

### Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language for data analysis and machine learning
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library
- NumPy: Numerical computing library
- Matplotlib: Data visualization library
- Seaborn: Data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib
- TensorFlow Keras: Machine learning framework for building and training predictive models

### Project Overview
The project aims to predict car sales using machine learning techniques. It involves the following key steps:

1. Data Collection: Gathering data on various car features, including make, model, year, price, mileage, and more.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis and modeling.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset to gain insights and visualize patterns.
4. Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features and creating new ones to improve model performance.
5. Model Building: Training machine learning models using historical data.
6. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics.
7. Predictions: Making predictions on car sales for new data.

### Folder Structure
The project's folder structure is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models.
- `src/`: Python source code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
